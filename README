Plex Reporter Script - stu@lifeofstu.com
----------------------------------------

PRS is a very simple script designed to show which clients have accessed what files on your server on the day you run it. It will output to the console what files have been accessed, and if you have configured the script with some email details (and your server/perl is capable of sending emails) it will also email you the information.


Requirements
------------

- Plex Media Server 	(tested with 0.9.5.2 on Linux)
- Perl 			(any 5.x release should work)
- MIME::Lite		(Perl module, available in most distros)
- XML::Simple		(Perl module, available in most distros)
- Curl 			(will move to LWP at some point)
- Grep/Sed 		(who doesnt have these installed?)

The script has been developed for use on a Linux system, however if you have Perl installed on a Mac (and the required perl modules) it should work. It may even work on a Windows system, however I have no intention of testing that...

Usage
-----

- Edit the script and change the documented variables at the top
- ./plex-reporter.pl
- Enjoy :-)
