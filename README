Plex Reporter Script - stu@lifeofstu.com
----------------------------------------

PRS is a very simple script designed to show which clients have accessed what files on your server on the day you run it. It will output to the console what files have been accessed, and if you have configured the script with some email details (and your server/perl is capable of sending emails) it will also email you the information.

You can also specify a date to check (rather than todays) if you want, see the usage instructions below.


Requirements
------------

- Plex Media Server 	(tested with 0.9.5.2 on Linux)
- Perl 			(any 5.x release should work)
- Data::Dumper		(Perl module, available on most distros)
- DateTime              (Perl module, available on most distros)
- Date::Calc		(Perl module, available on most distros)
- File::Basename	(Perl module, available on most distros)
- IO::Socket		(Perl module, available on most distros)
- LWP			(Perl module, available on most distros)
- MIME::Lite		(Perl module, available on most distros)
- XML::Simple		(Perl module, available on most distros)

The script has been developed for use on a Linux/OSX system. It may even work on a Windows system, however I have no intention of testing that...

If you are planning to run this on a Mac, you will need macports installed, and then the following packages:
- perl5
- p5-date-calc
- p5-datetime
- p5-libwww-perl
- p5-mime-lite
- p5-xml-simple


Usage
-----

- Move the plex-reporter.cfg file to one of the following locations:
    /etc/plex-reporter.cfg
    ~/.plex-reporter.cfg
- Edit the configuration file you just moved and change the documented variables
- ./plex-reporter.pl
- Enjoy :-)

If you want to specify a date (other than todays), use the following syntax:
  ./plex-reporter.pl -d "2012-02-30"

If you want to specify all dates in a month, use the following syntax:
  ./plex-reporter.pl -r "2012-01-01" "2012-01-31"

If you want XML output, use the following syntax:
  ./plex-reporter.pl -x test.xml

Note: The formatting of the date is important as it is what you grep the logfile for



OSX and Cronjobs
----------------

It's been noted that when running under Mac OSX (as a cronjob) the script doesn't work... This seems to be because /usr/bin/env doesn't work properly. To get around this, edit the top line of the script and change the #! line to point at your actual perl executable (tip: run 'which perl' to find out the path/executable).
